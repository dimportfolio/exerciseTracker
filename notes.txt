Things to improve

1. Exercises should have GUI so that sets and reps can be grouped under each exercise

ie:
Squats
sets 1 rep 10
sets 2 rep 10
sets 3 rep 10

vs:
squats
sets 1 rep 10
squats
sets 2 rep 10


2. The exercises should exist inside the component, currently the exercises are bleeding out when exceeding the height


Scaling - Future ideas
3. Add data metrics tab page, which will contain BI content 

4. Add user creation capability to track and log your data

5. Compare with other users in a x mile radius

6.
